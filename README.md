# Condition-Check-Practice-Credit-Card-Check
Credit card numbers follow certain patterns. A credit card number must have between 13 and 16 digits. The starting numbers are: 4 for Visa cards, 5 for MasterCard cards, 37 for American Express cards, and 6 for Discover cards
Double every second digit from right to left. If doubling of a digit results in
a two-digit number, add the two digits to get a single digit number
Now add all single-digit numbers from Step 1
Add all digits in the odd places from right to left in the card number
Sum the results from Step 2 and Step 3
If the result from Step 4 is divisible by 10, the card number is valid;
otherwise, it is invalid
